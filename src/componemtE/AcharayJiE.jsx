              <p data-aos="fade-up">The Scripture has meticulously framed rules of conduct for the ascetic (muni, sramana).
While scouting a true preceptor(guru), the following excerpt from Scârya Gunabhadra’s
</p>
              <p data-aos="fade-up">The one who has the wisdom about the reality of substances, has assimilated the core of the Scripture, knows the ways of the world, has no desire for worldly riches and honour, has sharp intellect, is serene, has sharp wit to know beforehand the answers to all future questions, has the ability to face with calmness almost all kinds of questions, enjoys lordship over the audience, is attractive, and is a repository of good qualities; such leader of the eongregation (sangfia) should deliver his discourse in clear and sweet words, without speaking ill of others.</p>
              <p data-aos="fade-up"> Atall order in this ’Aali age (the fifth aeon, called ‘dusamti’)? Yes, but present in this age also are pious souls, ascetics (muni, sramana) and householders Ésröra#ad, endowed with right-faith (samyahtua, samyag-darsana) who follow laudable conduct (cäritra) according to the level of the destruction-cum-subsidence (Asayopasama) of their conduct-deluding (cäritra-mohanï ya) karmas. Äcärya Visuddhasägara (born 18 December, 1971) is one such rare gem among the present-day ascetics.

              <p data-aos="fade-up">A digambara ascetie (nirgrañtha muni) since last twenty-nine years , Âcärya Visuddhasägara’s greatest commitment is to study the Scripture. A worthy son of ’Mother Jinavänï’, he spends maximum time, during the day and at night, in her service. With dedication and extraordinary concentration (eAägratä) he has brought out and assimilated profound concepts and tenets found deep in the ocean of the Scripture, with their associated five kinds of meanings — the word-meaning(sabdärtha), the standpoint- meaning (nayärtha), the sectarian-meaning (maförffia), the scriptural-meaning (ägamärtha) and the spiritual-meaning @/tôutirïfiad — beyond the reach of the ordinary souls.</p>

During this period-of-nurturing (ganaposana-häla), Äcärya Visuddhasägara has, till date, accorded Jaina-ordination (jinadïksä) to some thirty-eight choicest gems among the present-day worthy souls.

Äcärya Visuddhasägara takes great delight in delivering his discourses (prauacana). He believen that the subject matter of the discourse (pravacana) of every ascetic should only be the Scripture (ägama), nothing else. Although individuals looking for quick-fix solutions to their worldly woes through popular, but unproven, means including palmistry (/yotisad, sacred-utteranees (maüfra , and mystical-rituals (faüfra may find his discourses (pravacana) unfathomable, but the worthy listeners who long for lasting and true happiness — an attribute of the own-soul (ätmasvabhäva) — find these extremely helpfuland illuminating.

— called durnaya or faulty points-of-view — of the wrong-believers (mithyädrsti) with the sharp sword of ’syäduäda’. His discourses are rid of thèse eight faults associated with the absolutist (eAänta) views —durnaya:
