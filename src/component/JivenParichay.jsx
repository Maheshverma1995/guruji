                <p>Making mistakes is a natural part of the language learning process. 
                    The key is to learn from these mistakes. Don’t be afraid to try out new 
                    things in English but always remember to reflect on them and decide 
                    what was successful and what you need to keep working on.
                    Remember, it is possible to communicate big ideas with relatively 
                    limited language. Don’t feel like you need perfect English before you 
                    can go out and have interesting conversations with other people.</p>
